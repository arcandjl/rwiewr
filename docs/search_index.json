The impact evaluation was carried out by NORC at the University of Chicago: http://www.norc.org. Go to the project page at: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/lesotho-rural-water-supply-and-sanitation Download all of the materials. In particular, make sure that you have the “Final Evaluation Report Package,” and “Public Use Data Package.” Make sure you can replicate the descriptive statistics of Tables 4, 5 and 6. Replicate, the first two columns in Tables 7, 8 and 9 in the report: i.e. only replicate the columns of results where the heading is “Original Design” or “Observed Design” —ignore the columns where the heading is “Instrumental Variable” or “Matching”. Do this as best as you can: you probably won’t be able to get everything perfect, even in terms of the number of observations or the summary statistics –but you will get close. Notice that most of the results of Tables 7 and 8 (and one line in Table 9) include household fixed effects. You should carry out the “within” or first-difference transformation (they are identical here because there are 2 observations per household) before running the simple OLS regressions in R. Now carry out randomization inference on the results. Discuss. Now notice again that most of the results that you just replicated and improved upon using randomization inference are based on regressions that included household fixed effects. But does using fixed effects make sense in the context of an RCT? Why yes or why not? To guide you in terms of answering, note that last year I gave a problem that asked just this question (which means you already have an informational advantage!). In what follows, I reproduce that question from last year, and then ask you to apply your findings to the Lesotho study. Consider an RCT in which we have a baseline and an endline, which is the case here. Denoting the outcome by \\(Y_{t}\\), in which the baseline corresponds to \\(t=1\\) and post-intervention (endline) corresponds to \\(t=2\\), the simple difference between treated and control at \\(t=2\\) can be written as the OLS regression:% \\[ Y_{2}=D_{2}\\beta _{D}+U_{2}, \\] whereas the DID estimator (which is what the authors of the NORC report did for most outcomes) is given by: \\[ Y_{2}-Y_{1}=\\left( D_{2}-D_{1}\\right) \\beta _{DID}+U_{2}-U_{1}, \\] where of course \\(D_{1}=0\\) for everyone. In the absence of serial correlation in the disturbance terms, what should you do, include the fixed effects or not? Assume now that there is first-order serial correlation, that takes the form: \\[ U_{2}=\\rho U_{1}+e, \\] where \\(\\rho \\in \\lbrack -1,1]\\) and \\(e\\) is white noise. When should you difference and when should you not? (Hint: you are going to have to look at variances…) When should you condition on \\(Y_{1}\\), which would mean running: \\[ Y_{2}=Y_{1}\\gamma +D_{2}\\beta _{COND}+U_{2}? \\] You should answer this part of the question analytically. Now spend a limited amount of time running a simple Montecarlo experiment. Define potential outcomes as: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray*} Y_{11} &amp;=&amp;U_{11}, \\\\ Y_{01} &amp;=&amp;U_{01}, \\\\ Y_{12} &amp;=&amp;\\beta +U_{12}, \\\\ Y_{02} &amp;=&amp;U_{02}, \\end{eqnarray*} \\] where: \\[ \\left( U_{11},U_{01}\\right) \\sim N\\left( \\left( 0,0\\right) ,\\Sigma _{U}\\right) =N\\left( \\left( 0,0\\right) ,\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma _{U}^{2} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma _{U}^{2}% \\end{array}% \\right) \\right) , \\] and \\[ \\begin{eqnarray*} U_{12} &amp;=&amp;\\rho U_{11}+e_{11}, \\\\ U_{02} &amp;=&amp;\\rho U_{01}+e_{01}, \\end{eqnarray*} \\] where: \\[ \\left( e_{11},e_{01}\\right) \\sim N\\left( \\left( 0,0\\right) ,\\Sigma _{e}\\right) =N\\left( \\left( 0,0\\right) ,\\left( \\begin{array}{cc} \\sigma _{e}^{2} &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; \\sigma _{e}^{2}% \\end{array}% \\right) \\right) . \\] Generate a random treatment indicator \\(D\\), and construct observed outcomes as: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray*} Y_{1} &amp;=&amp;Y_{11}D+Y_{01}(1-D), \\\\ Y_{2} &amp;=&amp;Y_{12}D+Y_{02}(1-D). \\end{eqnarray*} \\] Consider the three linear regressions: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray*} Y_{2} &amp;=&amp;\\alpha +D\\beta _{D_{2}} \\\\ Y_{2}-Y_{1} &amp;=&amp;\\alpha +D\\beta _{DID} \\\\ Y_{2} &amp;=&amp;\\alpha +Y_{1}\\gamma +D\\beta _{COND}, \\end{eqnarray*} \\] and examine the variances of the three estimators as you vary $$. Now apply the intuition gleaned from both your analytical answer and these Montecarlo results to the Lesotho data, by comparing estimates of program impact based on each of the three estimators, with and without randomization inference. How do things change with respect to the replication exercise you carried out in Problem 1? What estimator do you come down in favor of? Why? BASE THIS ON STUDENT ANSWERS FROM THE 2018 PROBLEM SET 1 5.2.2 Instrumental variables Download the Senegalese panel dataset pnir.txt. There are three cross-sectional dimensions to the panel: child (\\(i\\), IDENF), household (\\(h\\), IDM), village (\\(v\\), CODEVILL). The time dimension is denoted by \\(t\\) (PERIODE). Covariates in your specifications should include: - period dummies; - the age of the child AGENF; - whether the household head can read LIRECM; - the log of the household head’s age LNAGECM; - whether there is a literacy program in the village PROGALPH; whether the village is hooked up to the national electricity grid ELECTVI; - the log of the population of the village LOGPOP. Suppose that you want to estimate the impact of projects constructed by the PNIR rural infrastructure program (PROJET) on a child’s weight-for-age z-score (WAZ). This is a standard anthropometric measures of child health. Treatment by a completed PNIR project obtains at the village level. Your exclusion restrictions for treatment by a PNIR project are given by three measures of village political power (which affect the probability that the village gets a project or not) given by: whether a villager is a member of the majority on the Conseil rural: MBMAJORI; whether a villager is a member of the biggest party on the Conseil rural: MBMAJOR1; the number of women from the village on the Conseil rural NBFEMME\\_. Compute the impact of the PNIR using the within-child instrumental variables estimator, and compare this to the corresponding within-household estimator.

People will often tell you that measurement error always results in attenuation bias. Indeed, this sometimes referred to as the “Iron Law of Econometrics.” This problem forces you to think this through more carefully. Consider the following “true” structural equation: \\[ Y_{i}=\\widetilde{D}_{i}\\beta +U_{i}, \\] but where we have “classical” errors in variables (CEV) in the treatment dummy in that observed treatment, \\(D_{i}\\), is given by: \\[ D_{i}=\\widetilde{D}_{i}+V_{i}, \\] where \\(E\\left[ V_{i}\\right] =0,\\) \\(cov[ \\widetilde{D}_{i},V_{i}]=0,\\) \\(cov\\left[ U_{i},V_{i}\\right] =0,\\) \\(cov[ U_{i},\\widetilde{D}_{i}] =0,\\) $var[ _{i}]=_{}^{2} $, \\(var[ V_{i}]=\\sigma _{V}^{2},\\) and where we therefore actually run the regression: \\[ Y_{i}=D_{i}\\beta +U_{i}. \\] Demonstrate that there is “attenuation bias” in \\(\\widehat{\\beta }_{OLS}\\); Now suppose that the true specification is given by: \\[ Y_{i}=\\widetilde{D}_{i}\\beta +X_{i}\\alpha +U_{i}, \\] where \\(X_{i}\\) is a covariate, and where \\(cov\\left[ D_{i},X_{i}\\right] \\neq 0,\\) \\(cov\\left[U_{i},X_{i}\\right] =0\\). Determine the large sample bias (i.e. the \\(plim\\)) in \\(\\widehat{\\beta }_{OLS}\\) and \\(\\widehat{\\alpha}_{OLS}\\) when we run \\(Y_{i}=D_{i}\\beta+X_{i}\\alpha +U_{i}\\); Does the Iron Law of Econometrics hold for \\(\\widehat{\\beta }_{OLS}?\\) Is the bias larger or smaller when there is a covariate \\(X_{i}?\\) What can you say when \\(cov\\left[ X_{i},V_{i}\\right] =0?\\) 5.4.2 To wrongs can make a right Griliches and Hausman (1986) Now forget about the PNIR and suppose that you want to estimate the impact of a child’s age (AGENF) on WAZ. Do this using the within-child and first-difference estimators. Now it could be that a child’s age is measured with error, because it is self-reported by the household head. Compute the Griliches and Hausman (1986) estimator of the effect, where you will obviously have to restrict your attention to the subset of observations for which \\(t\\geq3\\).

Your goal is to estimate the impact of being eligible for a PNIR project (LPNIR) on a child’s HAZ. The within-child estimate of this effect should be approximately 0.545 with a \\(p-\\)value of 0.038 when you cluster your standard errors at the village (CODEVILL) level. Include the same covariates as in Problem Set No. 2.} Note that this effect is quite large since the mean value of the HAZ in the sample is \\(-1.196\\) (\\(-1.235\\)) in the subset of children observed at least twice), so being eligible for the PNIR essentially halves stunting. Now imagine that you were unable} to follow children over time (i.e. you did not have the child identifier IDENF), and were forced to find some other manner ofcontrolling for time-invariant child characteristics. One manner of doing so would be to implement the Verbeek and Nijman (1993) pseudo-panel estimator. The time-invariant characteristics you will use to construct the cohorts are the child’s gender (FEMALE) and her/his date of birth (remember that the child’s age in months is given by AGENF).
